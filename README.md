# LoadingView
A loading indicator view that shows three circles pulsing in and out.

For convenience, use init(color:) which provides a standard size of 60.0 width and 14.0 height.

Otherwise, the size of the circles and the spacing between them will depend on frame size provided during init(frame:) or init(frame: color:).
